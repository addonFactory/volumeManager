* NVDA compatibility: 2018.2 to 2019.1

This addon allows you to manage windows master volume, as well as volume of different applications directly within NVDA.
It also makes possible to announce current volume level when changing with multimedia/function keys.

## Features ##

* Controll master volume;
* Control volume of different applications;
* Mute sound of applications and master volume;
* Announce volume level while changing with multimedia/function keys;
* Set desired level of master volume from a simple dialog.

## Using ##

All following shortcut keys must be pressed after turning layer gestures to on.
To turn layer gestures on/off, press  NVDA+Shift+v.
If you press this shortcut and hear high pitch tone, it means that an addon is turned on and you can use it. pressing this shortcut again will make low pitch tone, which means turning off an addon.

You can use following keys in layer mode:

* left and right arrows: move between master volume and applications volume controlls;
* Up and down arrows: changes volume of selected option;
* M: Mute sound of selected option;
* Spacebar: opens a dialog, where you can enter desired level of selected option and set it by pressing enter.

A big thanks goes to Yannick PLASSIARD, who created addon called "[Sound Manager][1]" from which idea of controlling volume of applications was taken.
